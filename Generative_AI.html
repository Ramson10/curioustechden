                <p>Pearl Ramson</p>

                <p>As 2024 draws to a close, this piece considers it the appropriate time 
                    to reflect on how AI has transformed the cyberspace so far.

                <p>Generative AI has dominated the cybersecurity realm throughout the year. Early at the 
                    beginning of the year, a MIT Technology Review "What’s Next Series" article predicted 
                    four major trends for AI before the end of the year.
                </p> 

                <p>Impressively, many of these predictions have materialized.</p> 

                <p>This piece examines these predictions, evaluates their realization, and delves into 
                    the overall impact of AI on cybersecurity in 2024.
                </p> 
                
                <h2>Analyzing The 4 Predictions</h2>

                <p>1. One of the top predictions stated, “In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily 
                    in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products.”
                </p> 

                <p>Obviously, this prediction hits the mark. To use OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4.0 requires users 
                    paying subscription fee, even though there is a limited free version. There are, 
                    in fact, pricing tiers introduced to appeal to various customer segments.
                </p> 

                <p>Similarly, competitors like Anthropic and Google have also implemented pricing models 
                    for their platforms, Claude and Bard respectively. These monetization strategies underscore 
                    the increasing commercialization of generative AI tools.
                </p> 

                <p>2. Another prediction foresaw “Generative AI’s second wave will be video”.</p> 

                <p>AI-driven text-to-image models have been prominent since 2022. Now, Runway and 
                    Pika Labs have spearheaded AI-generated video content creation innovation throughout the year.
                </p>

                <p>As it is, text-to-video has now become the new frontier gaining substantial 
                    traction, in what seems to be an accurate prediction.
                </p> 

                <p>3. The third prediction alerted that, “AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere.”</p> 

                <p>The article further anticipated the widespread use of deepfakes for creating misleading 
                    content during electioneering periods globally, “AI-generated election disinformation 
                    and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024”,
                </p> 

                <p>Two cases of AI-generated election disinformation were cited in Argentina where, “two 
                    presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them”, and 
                    Slovakia where “deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price 
                    of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections”
                </p> 

                <p>Prior the last U.S.-presidential election, concerns about deepfake technologies were similarly prominent.</p> 

                <p>4. Finally, the “robots that multitask” was the fourth prediction and the only one that stands out as an outlier. 
                    There was little to show for its practical implementation so far in 2024.
                </p> 

                <p>While robotics and automation advanced, the multitasking capabilities remain underexplored.</p> 

                <h2>Generative AI in Cyber Defense: What the Predictions Overlooked</h2>

                <p>Generative AI has carved a niche in cybersecurity in 2024, and MIT Technology Review’s predictions seem to miss this. 
                    This year marks the emergence of Generative AI as a groundbreaking and robust defense tool against malicious cyber activities.
                </p> 

                <p>Organizations’, worldwide, growing reliance on digital operations has amplified their needs for advanced, real-time threat detection 
                    mechanisms. And Generative AI seems to be providing the much-needed answer at the moment with its ability to quickly process large 
                    datasets, detect anomalies, and anticipate vulnerabilities.
                </p> 

                <h3>AI-Driven Threat Detection Tools</h3>

                <p>Unlike traditional tools that rely on predefined rules, AI-powered systems employ machine-learning models 
                    to identify subtle patterns indicative of cyber threats before they materialize into full-blown attacks. 
                    Sometimes, human insight is combined to enhance operational accuracy.
                </p> 
                
                <p>Here are some top AI-threat detection tools below:</p>

                <h4>Microsoft Sentinel:</h4>

                <p>Top of the list of AI threat detection tool is Microsoft Sentinel, an AI-driven security information and event management (SIEM) system. 
                    Sentinel uses AI to monitor vast amounts of network traffic and logs to identify unusual behavior or anomalies.
                </p> 

                <h4>IBM’s QRadar:</h4>

                <p>QRadar is a threat detection platform that integrates human insights with automated responses. The AI-human synergy 
                    ensures that false positives or ambiguous threats are thoroughly evaluated before action is taken.
                </p> 

                <h4>Meta’s PyTorch Live Monitor</h4>

                <p>From Meta, PyTorch, constantly evaluates the performance and security of AI models deployed 
                    in production to identify potential vulnerabilities before adversaries exploit them.
                </p> 

                <h2>AI in Combating Phishing</h2>

                <p>Generative AI is particularly effective in combating phishing. Traditional systems rely on 
                    blacklisted URLs or suspicious email formats, but AI models analyze linguistic patterns, 
                    sender reputation, and metadata to flag phishing attempts.
                </p> 

                <p>For instance, companies like Darktrace deploy AI to detect zero-day malware—malicious 
                    software for which no signature exists—by analyzing its behavior in isolated environments.
                </p> 

                <p>In another reported scenario, Darktrace reported how its advanced AI quickly 
                    uncovered a phishing attack to “compromised an internal email account” with VPN. 
                    It claimed that through its advanced AI capabilities, it “effectively identified the threat 
                    and brought it to the attention of the customer’s security team”, in what indicates AI deployment in digital security.
                </p> 

                <p>These are indications that there is wide adoption of Generative AI in cybersecurity and we should expect more onward.</p> 

                <h2>Regulation and Policy: A Year of Action</h2>

                <p>Unlike 2023, we have seen more of AI policy and regulation implementation in 2024.</p> 

                <p>According to MIT Technology Review report, “If 2023 was the year lawmakers agreed on a vision, 2024 will be the year 
                    policies start to morph into concrete action.” The “concrete action” has already set the ball rolling.
                </p> 

                <p>In the U.S., President Biden has issued an executive order on AI at the end of October 2023. With the order emerges US’s AI policy.</p> 

                <p>Experts have, however, noted that the policy is friendly to AI industry, “with an emphasis on best practices, a reliance on different 
                    agencies to craft their own rules, and a nuanced approach of regulating each sector of the economy differently”, explained MIT Technology Review.
                </p> 

                <p>Similarly, the European Union Parliament has finalized the AI Act in the first half of 2024, as reported by MIT Technology Review. 
                    It added that, “the EU believes that the most powerful AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini, could 
                    pose a “systemic” risk to citizens and thus need additional work to meet EU standards.”
                </p> 

                <p>The EU is equally working on AL Liability Directive, a bill which ensures that people harmed by AI can get financial compensation.</p> 

                <p>Elsewhere, China’s regulation of AI has been “piecemeal’ so far, but an “artificial intelligence law’ has become 
                    top legislative agenda for China’s state council, China’s top governing council.
                </p> 

                <h2>The Double-Edged Sword: Emergence of Adversarial AI</h2>

                <p>While generative AI has made headline so far in 2024 as an enhanced threat detection tool, it has also open 
                    doors for adversarial AI—where cybercriminals use AI to outsmart defensive systems. Adversarial attacks manipulate 
                    AI algorithms, feeding them misleading data to bypass security measures.
                </p> 

                <p>Another growing concern is the use of generative AI for creating deepfake content, 
                    which can be used to impersonate individuals or bypass biometric authentication systems. 
                </p>
                
                <p>In 2022, researchers also demonstrated how adversarial AI could manipulate an image classifier into 
                    misidentifying malware as benign software by subtly altering its code. 
                </p>

                <p>This underlines the emerging dual nature of AI as an enhanced cyber-defensive tool on 
                    one hand, and a potential offensive-weapon on another.
                </p> 

                <h2>Final Thoughts: Is the Future of AI Promising or Damning?</h2>

                <p>Generative AI has been reshaping the landscape of cybersecurity so far, offering unprecedented 
                    capabilities in threat detection and system fortification. As we stand, it appears more is still to come.
                </p> 

                <p>However, there is an ongoing high-stake battle in this digital realm that needs to be 
                    defeated because adversaries can weaponize this same celebrated-tools that empower defenders.
                </p> 

                <p>Moving forward, the path to victory may lie in the synergy between advanced 
                    AI and ethical governance on one hand, and human expertise on another.
                </p> 

                <p>These elements will be crucial in determining whether generative AI remains a robust ally or a 
                    double-edged sword with a promising or damning future when the world becomes where the next threat is just a click away.
                </p>
