                <h4 class="about-me-h4">Hi, I’m Pearl Ramson!</h4>
    
                <p>I’m a freelance writer who wears many hats— journalist, 
                full-stack developer, and ethical hacker (aka Mr. bug hunter).
                </p>
    
                <p>Within the past seven years, I’ve been helping brands, blogs, and businesses 
                alike craft high-quality contents that are engaging and impactful. 
                </p>
    
                <p>Writing isn’t just what I do; it’s how I connect the dots between creativity and technology.</p>
    
                <h4>My Journey into Writing</h4>
    
                <p>I earned my degree in Journalism (Broadcasting) in 2016 and stepped into the world of freelance writing a year later. </p>
    
                <p>As a newbie, I explored a little bit of everything—history, politics, academic writing, tech, and more.</p>
    
                <p>Those early days honed my adaptability, but by 2018, I found my true calling in tech writing, 
                where my background in tech (web development, cybersecurity, blockchain, IoT, etc.) made all the difference.
                </p>
    
                <h4>Experience so far</h4>
