                <p>Do you have a dead Android phone with precious memories - photos, videos, music - that you thought were 
                    lost forever? If so, here’s some good news: recovering data from a seemingly “dead” Android phone is indeed possible.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Many assume that if a phone is dead or unresponsive, data recovery is out of reach. 
                    But with the right tools and the steps I will show you here, you can regain access to your files.
                </p>

                <p>A “dead” Android phone, in this context, means any phone that’s unresponsive or inaccessible 
                    due to issues like boot loop, forgotten password, bricked device, or hardware malfunction. 
                    While these issues may prevent normal access, they don’t necessarily mean your data is gone for good.
                </p>

                <p>If you've already tried multiple software solutions with no success, don’t worry. 
                    This tutorial walks you through a proven, 100%-free method to recover data from 
                    a dead Android phone with an intact memory. So, let’s get started!
                </p>

                <p>Note:</p>

                <p>This method works as long as the phone’s memory hasn’t been wiped through flashing or 
                    factory resetting. Stay tuned for updates as we continue exploring ways to recover data 
                    from factory-reset or flashed phones. You should know we are committed to satisfying the curiosity of every reader here.

                <h2>Tools Needed</h2>

                <p>A personal computer</p>

                <p>Internet access</p>

                <p>USB cable</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Tutorial</h2>

                <h3>Step 1: Download SP Flash Tool </h3>

                <p>First, download the latest SP Flash Tool from spflashtools.com in zip format (version 5.2316 
                    seems to be the latest as of 2024). Extract the zip folder to any location on your pc.
                </p>

                <img src="img/SP Flash Tool 1.png" alt="sp flash tool zip">

                <p style="text-align: center;">========================================================</p>

                <img src="img/SP Flash Tool 2.png" alt="sp flash tool">
                    
                <p>The SP Flash Tool is primarily used to flash firmware on devices with MediaTek chips. It 
                    can also be used to access phone memory with MediaTek chips even without a battery 
                    inserted in them. Here, we’ll use it to access the phone’s memory.
                </p> 

                <img src="img/SP Flash Tool 3.png" alt="sp flash tool program" >

                <h3>Step 2: Download <a href="https://ava5.androidfilehost.com/dl/2KEgeiGcATfYuPCXP5KQzA/1715603623/24269982087012126/Windows+10_MTK+VCOM+USB+Preloader+Drivers.zip" style="text-decoration: none;">(from this link)</a> and Install MTK VCOM Preloader USB Drivers</h3>

                <P>This driver allows SP Flash Tool to communicate with your phone even without a battery. 
                    Installing this driver is somewhat technical, so follow the installation 
                    instructions <a href="https://www.ytechb.com/mtk-vcom-usb-drivers-windows-10/" style="text-decoration: none;">(from this link)</a> carefully.
                </P>

                <p>Without this driver, SP Flash Tool won’t detect or read the phone.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Find and Download Your Phone’s Stock Firmware</h3>

                <p>Next, download the stock firmware for your specific phone model from your manufacturer’s website or a trusted site.</p>

                <p>From the firmware, we have to get the phone’s scatter file. Scatter file usually is a 
                    text document that contains essential information about the phone’s memory layout. 
                    SP Flash Tool requires this file to work effectively.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: Load the Scatter File in SP Flash Tool</h3>

                <p>Launch SP Flash Tool by opening the `flash_tool.exe` file in the folder you extracted 
                    earlier - one good thing is the program is plug and play.
                </p> 

                <img src="img/sp program.png" alt="sp homepage">

                <p>By default, you’ll be in the “Download” tab. Click the “Choose” button next to 
                    the “Scatter-loading File” line to load your scatter file.
                </p>

                <p>Once the scatter file downloads, you should see something like the picture below.</p>

                <img src="img/sp scatter file.png" alt="sp scatter file">

                <p>Ensure you have downloaded the correct scatter file, please!</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Run a Memory Test</h3>

                <p>Switch to the “memory Test” tab. Here, you need to run a memory test to get the size of the memory intended for recovery. </p>

                <p>Check all boxes under the “Select Memory Test Method” or just click the Select 
                    All button below the boxes. Then, click the start button at the right hand side to begin the test.
                </p>

                <img src="img/memory test.png" alt="memory test">

                <p>The test should take some few minutes. Once the test completes, note down the EMMC_PART_USER’s 
                    figure shown after the result. The figure indicates the size of the phone memory we want to backup. 
                    We will need it later after this process is completed.
                </p>

                <img src="img/memory test 2.png" alt="memory test result">

                <p>At the front of the EMMC_PART_USER, there is Size and then a figure like this: 
                    0x00000001d2800000(7464MB). This shows the connected phone has a 8GB memory.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 6: Set Up Readback in SP Flash Tool</h3>

                <p>Switch over to the “Readback” tab. This is where we need the EMMC_PART_USER’s figure from the memory test.</p>

                <p>Click the “Add” button to create a new readback file. 
                </p>

                <img src="img/readback 1.png" alt="add readback">

                <p>Once completed, double 
                    click on the newly created readback file to save the file in a location on your computer.
                </p>

                <img src="img/readback 2.png" alt="save readback">

                <p>Upon saving the file, a new page will appear as shown below.</p>

                <img src="img/readback block start.png" alt="new readback">

                <p>On this page, we will configure the region and length of memory we want to readback. 
                    Click the dropdown button in front of “Region” and select EMMC_USER. Leave the 
                    start address as it is but change the “Length” address to the EMMC_PART_USER’s figure we got under the “Memory Test” tab.
                </p>

                <img src="img/readback connfiguration.png" alt="readback connfiguration">

                <p>Now, we are set to readback the memory of the phone. By now, the “Read 
                    Back” button is activated. Click on it and wait for the process to complete 
                    within some minutes depending on the size of the phone’s memory.
                </p>

                <img src="img/readback process.png" alt="readback process">

                <p style="text-align: center;">====================================</p>

                <img src="img/readback in progress.png" alt="readback in progress">

                <h3>Step 7: Mount the Readback File with OSFMount</h3>

                <p>Once step 6 is completed, locate the saved readback file on your PC. 
                    You can’t read the file yet. In fact, it is completely meaningless 
                    because it is in Hex format unless we have a means to read it.
                </p>

                <p>This is where OSFMount comes in. OSFMount allows us to mount image 
                    files as a virtual drive on Windows. With it, we will be able to mount 
                    our readback file as a virtual disk so that we can save its content in a meaningful format.
                </p>

                <p>You can download it online from this <a href="https://www.osforensics.com/downloads/osfmount.exe" style="text-decoration: none;"> link.</a></p>

                <p>Open OSFMount after the installation is completed. Click on “Mount new” at the bottom left of the program.</p>

                <img src="img/osf mount.png" alt="osf mount">

                <p>The mounting process has four stages. In the first stage, you have to 
                    select the disk image file and the type you want to mount.
                </p>

                <img src="img/osf mount stage 1.png" alt="osf mount stage 1">

                <p>Select Disk image file and move on to navigate to the location you 
                    saved the readback file earlier on and select it. Click next to move on to stage 2.
                </p>

                <img src="img/osf mount stage 2.png" alt="osf mount stage 2">

                <p>In this stage, chose “Mount entire image as virtual disks” and click next.</p>

                <p>Quite surprising, OSFMount usually jumps from stage 2 to 4, so you automatically 
                    jump to step 4 from step 2 on clicking next.
                </p>

                <img src="img/osf mount 4.png" alt="stage 4">

                <p>In stage 4, check the “Mount as removable media” and leave all other 
                    options in their default selection. Then, click on mount to mount the virtual disk on Windows.
                </p>

                <p>OSFMount will mount the virtual disk by assigning it letters from “E” to “Z”.</p>

                <img src="img/osf mount mounted-drive.png" alt="drive mounted">

                <p>However, it is very common that the files may not be accessible 
                    immediately because a Windows prompt usually appears asking to 
                    format the drive before it opens. 
                </p>

                <img src="img/osf mount format box.png" alt="format box">
                    
                <p>This means the original readback file is not a valid system file.
                </p>

                <p>We won’t be able to access the virtual drives on the computer with this situation. But, there is a solution.</p>

                <p>We need to find a good data recovery software to access the virtual drive. 
                    You can try any data recovery software you know but Power Data Recovery 
                    software seems to be the best for this task. You can check it 
                    <a href="http://www.powerdatarecovery.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">here.</a> 
                </p>

                <h3>Step 8: Recover Files with Power Data Recovery Software</h3>

                <p>Download Power Data Recovery software from the link in step 7. 
                    It doesn’t need installation because it is a plug and play program. 
                    Another good news is that it is fantastic and free so far it is for home use.
                </p>

                <p>Open the program and click on “Lost Partition Recovery”.</p>

                <img src="img/lost partition.png" alt="lost partition">
                
                <p>
                    We have to assume we want to recover data from the lost virtual drives.
                </p>
                
                <p>The program will scan for all attached devices and, luckily, our mounted virtual drives are included, too.</p>

                <img src="img/partition scanning.png" alt="partition scanning">

                <p>Once the attached devices appear, you have to click on the virtual 
                    drives one after the other.
                </p>  

                <img src="img/attached partitions.png" alt="attached partition">

                <p>
                    Watch out for drives with heavy size because they usually have the highest number of files. 
                    In fact, the drive with the highest size usually contains phones’ data.
                </p>

                <img src="img/attached partition 2.png" alt="attached partition">

                <p>Before we move on, we have to set the extent and type of files we want to recover.
                </p>

                <P>Click on the “Advanced Setting” button to go to the page.</P> 

                <img src="img/advance settings.png" alt="advance settings">

                <p>For best recovery, check all boxes and click ok.</P>

                <img src="img/advance setting 2.png" alt="advance setting">

                <p>Now, highlight any of the virtual disk and click on the “Full Scan” button. 
                    The scan will commence and should take some moments depending on the disk size.
                </p>

                <img src="img/full scan.png" alt="full scan">

                <p>On completion, you should have something like the image below:</p>

                <img src="img/scan result.png" alt="scan result">

                <p>Then, firstly highlight the partition, then click on “Show Files” at the top left hand side of the program.</p>

                <img src="img/show files.png" alt="show files">
                
                <p>Here we have our files in various format. You can navigate through them as you desire.</p>

                <img src="img/result files.png" alt="scan result files">

                <p>To recover files in any of the folder, right-click on the folder and select “Recover” 
                    from the options available. 
                </p>

                <img src="img/recovery process.png" alt="recovery process">

                <p>Select a location to save the files and begin the process.</p>

                <img src="img/saving recovered files.png" alt="saving recovered files">

                <p>That’s it. With this method, you can recover your audios, pictures, videos, etc. on literarily any dead phone.</p>
