                <p>Have you ever encountered the dreaded fileless malware attack? Let me share my experience.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Recently, I suspected I was under a fileless attack.
                </p>

                <p>I had an ongoing legal tussle with some supposedly powerful men whose plea 
                    bargain had fell on deaf ears. Unexpectedly, they resorted to underhanded 
                    tactics, one of which is to fix some moles around me to steal some sensitive 
                    information from my PC.
                </p>

                <p>One of them was able to have access to my pc via a USB drive. 
                    Despite thorough checks after the incident, I found nothing suspicious.
                </p>

                <p>Well, I moved on until my Windows Defender’s Controlled Folder 
                    Access (CFA) alerted me of blocking PowerShell from executing some 
                    command in the background. Then it struck me – I might have been under a fileless attack.
                </p>

                <p>Why would they use this method? The answer is simple: they knew they were up against someone 
                    tech-savvy, equipped with strong defenses They know I would be able to detect 
                    the traditional type of malware with anti-virus and all sort.
                </p>

                <p>I swung into action immediately to investigate the situation to thwart any ongoing attack.</p>

                <p>Although the results were negative, the experience inspired me to write about fileless malware. 
                    Someone else might face a similar threat and need a solution.
                </p>

                <h1>What is a Filless Malware Attack?</h1>

                <p>Traditional malware often requires a file, an executable program, 
                    to infiltrate a system. Fileless malware, on the other hand, bypasses 
                    this need by using legitimate tools and processes, usually built-in 
                    system utilities already present on your PC without leaving traditional 
                    file footprints to evade detection.
                </p>

                <p>Commonly, attackers would exploit high-privilege, legitimate 
                    and trusted system software such as PowerShell, Windows Management 
                    Instrumentation (WMI), or command-line tools like command prompt to 
                    execute their malicious scripts to enable them deep system access 
                    without triggering conventional antivirus software.
                </p>

                <p>While traditional malware leaves an executable file on the disk, fileless 
                    malware is a memory-based attack that operates entirely in the RAM. 
                    This method leaves no files for antivirus programs to scan or detect as 
                    malicious, and can even evade modern defenses.
                </p>    
                    
                <p>Fileless attack is such a serious attack not only because it utilizes system-based 
                    software to disguise but due to its stealth nature. 
                </p>    

                <p>To compound this, it is approximately ten times more likely to succeed compared 
                    to traditional malware and can bypass traditional signature-based detection.
                </p>    

                <h2>Fileless and Other Malware: The Difference</h2>

                <table class="table">

                    <tr>

                        <th>Traditional malware</th>

                </table>

                <h2>Preventing/Thwarting The Attack</h2>

                <p>To prevent and stop this kind of attack, we need to understand how it operates.</p> 
                
                <p>Most often, this malware is introduced via phishing emails or malicious links that 
                    launch scripts within a trusted application. Commonly, PowerShell, Windows Management 
                    Instrumentation (WMI) or other command line interface like command prompt are
                    trusted system-based software used in perpetrating the attack.
                </p> 

                <p>A report by Aqua Security highlighted a staggering 1400% increase in fileless 
                    attack vectors in 2023, driven by the exploitation of tools like PowerShell
                    and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
                </p> 

                <p>For this reason, I was suspicious of the notification that a PowerShell 
                    operation in the background was blocked – coming days after my pc was 
                    physically breached. No amount of carefulness can be too much when dealing with this kind of attack.
                </p>

                <p>Attackers’ scripts exploit vulnerabilities in applications or use macros in Office 
                    files to gain initial access. Once they gain access, they can execute malicious 
                    code directly in the system memory, allowing them to steal data, install spyware, or disrupt system processes.  
                </p>

                <p>Many of the attacks, in fact, achieve persistence by exploiting system registries or using scheduled tasks.</p> 

                <h2>Signs of a Fileless Malware</h2>

                <p>To ensure you are not under attack of a fileless malware, there are many signs you 
                    should watch out for. Even though it is not an exhaustive list, those below may be signs you are under attack.
                </p>

                <ul>
                        
                    <li>Unexpected drop in system performance (I experienced this).</li> 
                    <li>Abnormal outbound network traffic (although I experienced it, it later turns out the traffic was legit).</li>
                    <li>Unfamiliar administrative tasks or accounts.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Preventive Solution</h2>

                <p>There is no all-in-one ultimate defensive solution against fileless malware attack. 
                    But there are some proactive and reactive measures you can take.
                </p>

                <h3>Proactive measures</h3>

                <h4>Protect against WMI abuse</h4>

                <p>WMI may be a powerful tool for legitimate administrative purposes. So also, it is 
                    commonly a target for abuse because it is a trusted, high-privilege level, pre-installed Windows tool. 
                </p>

                <p>To protect against this abuse or being used as a weapon to push you down your kneels, take the following precautions:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Use tools like Windows Event Logs or Sysmon to track WMI activity.</li>
                    <li>Limit WMI access to trusted users and processes.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Use Multi-Layered Security</h3>

                <p>Combine antivirus with advanced threat protection tools that specialize in behavioral analysis.</p>

                <h4>Be Vigilant</h4>

                <p>As a first defensive measure, be wary of phishing emails, unexpected attachments, unusual or random links.</p>

                <h4>Update Software Regularly</h4>
                
                <p>Always keep your operating system and applications updated regularly as patched 
                    applications close vulnerabilities attackers may exploit.  
                </p>

                <h3>Reactive measures</h3>

                <h4>Check for Suspicious Activity</h4>

                <ul>

                    <li>Run a full system scan using Windows Defender or a third-party tool like Malwarebytes to ensure your system is clean.</li>
                    <li>Also verify logs using Event Viewer to check for suspicious PowerShell commands. Check 
                        under “Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell”
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Protect against PowerShell abuse</h4>

                <p>Just like WMI, PowerShell is a trusted, high-privilege level, pre-installed Windows tool that is commonly a target for abuse. 
                    To protect against this or you are concerned about ongoing risks, do the following:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Use AppLocker or Group Policy Editor to restrict PowerShell usage to specific trusted users or applications.</li>
                    <li>Disable scripting features temporarily by setting PowerShell's execution policy to “Restricted.”</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Stay Vigilant!</h2>

                <p>Beware that fileless malware trend is likely to grow as attackers refine techniques to outpace 
                    traditional and even modern defenses. Even the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions 
                    and remote work environments has enabled the expansion of attack surface.
                </p>

                <p>Fileless attacks have become adopted approach for ransomware actors to stealthily deliver ransomware payloads and encrypt systems.</p>

                <p>What do all those mean?</p>

                <p>Be vigilant! Always!</p>
