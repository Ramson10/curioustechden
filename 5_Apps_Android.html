                <p>I once wrote a blog post about detecting and removing malware from PCs using Windows’ built-in utility 
                    applications. And, somehow, the aspect of using Windows built-in utility programs has sparked 
                    curiosity in some pals to find out effective android equivalents.
                </p>

                <img src="img/android security.png" alt="android security" >

                <p>While there may be no android equivalent, some third-party applications can serve same purpose, as this post will show. Let’s dive in.</p>

                <h2>Why Android Security is Paramount</h2>

                <p>Device security has never been more critical than this era.</p>

                <p>According to IOT analytics report, there are about 18.8 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices currently 
                    in use globally, and this number is growing at an annual rate of approximately 13%. 
                    Projections estimate this figure will surpass 29 billion IoT devices by 2030. 
                    These include smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices in consumer, industrial, and enterprise settings
                </p>

                <p>With the growing reliance on mobile devices for personal and professional activities comes the attendant consequence 
                    in the unprecedented increase in attacks and exploitations.
                </p>

                <p>Generally, mobile phones are more susceptible to threats than PC because of their constant internet connection. 
                    Regular internet connectivity via Wi-Fi or cellular data means increased exposure to threats.
                </p>

                <p>Attackers can also exploit android users through third-party stores, where they can lure users to install malicious 
                    apps unknowingly. Through the app, they can gain remote access to their device for whatever purpose.
                </p>

                <p>Many phone users also have little awareness of cybersecurity risks, show a high level of negligence and low 
                    security-consciousness – and malicious actors have always exploit this to their advantage.
                </p>

                <p>Even security-conscious individuals out there often have limited tools at their disposal to monitor and manage 
                    their phones’ security. So, it is less surprising the curiosity behind knowing applications that effectively manage android security.
                </p>

                <h2>Monitoring and Thwarting Attacks on Android Phones</h2>

                <h3>Primary Protection First</h3>

                <p>Before we move on, this post only focuses on secondary security measures.</p>

                <p>Primary preventive measures such as using strong password, updating OS and apps regularly, installing anti-virus app, 
                    avoiding suspicious links, downloading apps only from trusted sources, etc., must firstly be in place.
                </p>

                <h2>Third-Party Protection Apps</h2>

                <p>The focus from this point onward is reviewing third-party 
                    applications that are effective in monitoring and preventing android device’s breach.
                </p>

                <p>For an attacker to gain remote access to your device, they need to create a backdoor entry through malware to establish a connection. 
                    This means they have to establish a connection between them and your device.
                </p>

                <p>Whether as a proactive or reactive measures, these third-party applications are excellent Windows equivalent in 
                    monitoring and preventing such malicious connection in real time. They are capable of fishing out compromised 
                    application and take necessary actions as deem fit.
